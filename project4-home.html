					<h3>About Us</h3>
					<p id="p1">Here at Guitar Builders we are dedicated to making instruments that are as unique as the players who play them. Down to ever specification our aim to create something that is a work of art itself. Over the years, we have crafted instruments for the likes of world class musicians such as Sidd the Kidd, Cheries Chapaue, and of course - the legendary Jimmy-David Hendmore, along with dozens of other world renown artists. We know that as a guitarist, you are passionate about your craft, and at Guitar Builders, so are we. Our talented team is made up of lifelong guitarists who know exactly what is needed out of a guitar, just like you. We are confident that whatever your vision is, we can create it.</p>
